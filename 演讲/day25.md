The monument at the city center once stood as a symbol of harmony—until the riot erupted. Protesters swung iron rods and sprayed paint, leaving the marble surface pockmarked with hollow dents. I picked up a broken fragment—it would become my heaviest souvenir.
市中心的monument曾经象征着城市的harmony，直到那场riot爆发。愤怒的人群swung铁棍，sprayed油漆，让大理石表面布满hollow的凹痕。我弯腰捡起一块碎片——这将成为我最沉重的souvenir。
As the lead restoration engineer, I had to sift through dense archives for the original charter. Every measurement had to be accurate: the penetration depth of each crack, the precise coordinates for repairs. But when my assistant handed me the 3D scans, the data for the load-bearing pillars was completely invalid.
作为负责修复的工程师，我需要在dense的档案中找出原始charter。数据必须绝对accurate：每道裂痕的penetration深度、每个修复点的precise坐标。助手递来的3D扫描图却显示，关键承重柱的数据完全invalid。
"Impossible!" I boasted. "My precision measurements are never wrong!" But as I recalibrated the scanner, my clumsy elbow knocked over a solvent bottle. The liquid spilled across the circuit board, sparks splashing up at my face.
"这不可能！"我boasted，"我的测量precision从未出错！"但当我重新检测时，clumsy地碰倒了溶剂瓶，液体spilled在电路板上，火花splashed到脸上。
Under the gloom of emergency lights, the mayor dismissed my team. "You've turned this memorial into an awkward jigsaw puzzle," he said coldly. Condensation fogged the windows, obscuring the pierced inscriptions.
在gloom的应急灯下，市长dismissed了我的团队。"你们把memorial变成了awkward的拼图游戏，"他冷冷地说。雾气在玻璃上形成condensation，模糊了那些被pierced的碑文。
On the last subway train, I apologized to my sacked colleagues. The car swayed, and my design chart slipped to the floor. That’s when I saw it—the seemingly random cracks formed the outline of another, far older monument...
最后一班地铁上，我apologized给被sacked的同事们。列车swayed，手中的设计chart滑落在地。这时我才看清：那些看似随机的裂痕，分明组成了另一个更古老的monument轮廓......
Under the flickering subway lights, I studied the cracked sketch that had fallen from my chart. The lines formed an antique structure—one not listed in any city archives. Was this the real monument we were meant to restore?
地铁惨白的灯光下，我凝视着从图纸堆滑落的残缺草图。那些线条勾勒出一座古董建筑——任何市政档案都未记载的构造。或许这才是我们真正该修复的纪念碑？
My team regrouped at dawn. "We need to insert this discovery into the official report," I said, tapping the draft. Li Wei objected: "That's evidence tampering! The customs office weighed every document before the installation began."
破晓时分，团队重新集结。"必须把这份发现插入正式报告，"我敲着草案说。李伟立即反对："这是篡改证据！海关早在工程安装前就核验过所有文件。"
A van suddenly hijacked our conversation—black-clad men launched a raid, snatching our blueprints. "They're after the same design!" shouted Chen, rubbing his stained sleeve where coffee had spilled during the struggle.
一辆厢式车突然劫持了我们的对话——黑衣人发动突袭，抢走了设计图。"他们也在找这个！"陈大喊，揉着被咖啡泼洒弄脏的袖口。
At police HQ, Inspector Luo slid a bribe across the table. "Forget this case. The corruption runs deeper than you know." His eyes darted to a triple-locked cabinet marked "Punishment Files."
警局里，罗警官将贿赂推过桌面："别查了。这里的腐败比你想的更深。"他目光扫向标着"惩戒档案"的三重密码柜。
That night, we broke in. The maximum security system took minutes to extinguish. Inside, a dual-layered map revealed the truth: our monument was a hatch to a wartime bunker. The city's founders had built their pretence of peace atop buried secrets.
当夜我们潜入时，最高级别安防系统只花了五分钟就解除。柜中一份双层地图揭示真相：我们的纪念碑实为战时地堡的舱门。建城者们将和平的假象筑在了秘密之上。
As the investigation reached its climax, I realized—we weren't just restoring stone. We were peeling back the horizon of history itself.
当调查走向高潮，我终于明白——我们要修复的不只是石头，更是历史地平线之下的真相。
