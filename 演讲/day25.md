The monument at the city center once stood as a symbol of harmony—until the riot erupted. Protesters swung iron rods and sprayed paint, leaving the marble surface pockmarked with hollow dents. I picked up a broken fragment—it would become my heaviest souvenir.

As the lead restoration engineer, I had to sift through dense archives for the original charter. Every measurement had to be accurate: the penetration depth of each crack, the precise coordinates for repairs. But when my assistant handed me the 3D scans, the data for the load-bearing pillars was completely invalid.

"Impossible!" I boasted. "My precision measurements are never wrong!" But as I recalibrated the scanner, my clumsy elbow knocked over a solvent bottle. The liquid spilled across the circuit board, sparks splashing up at my face.

Under the gloom of emergency lights, the mayor dismissed my team. "You've turned this memorial into an awkward jigsaw puzzle," he said coldly. Condensation fogged the windows, obscuring the pierced inscriptions.

On the last subway train, I apologized to my sacked colleagues. The car swayed, and my design chart slipped to the floor. That’s when I saw it—the seemingly random cracks formed the outline of another, far older monument...

Under the flickering subway lights, I studied the cracked sketch that had fallen from my chart. The lines formed an antique structure—one not listed in any city archives. Was this the real monument we were meant to restore?

My team regrouped at dawn. "We need to insert this discovery into the official report," I said, tapping the draft. Li Wei objected: "That's evidence tampering! The customs office weighed every document before the installation began."

A van suddenly hijacked our conversation—black-clad men launched a raid, snatching our blueprints. "They're after the same design!" shouted Chen, rubbing his stained sleeve where coffee had spilled during the struggle.

At police HQ, Inspector Luo slid a bribe across the table. "Forget this case. The corruption runs deeper than you know." His eyes darted to a triple-locked cabinet marked "Punishment Files."

That night, we broke in. The maximum security system took minutes to extinguish. Inside, a dual-layered map revealed the truth: our monument was a hatch to a wartime bunker. The city's founders had built their pretence of peace atop buried secrets.

As the investigation reached its climax, I realized—we weren't just restoring stone. We were peeling back the horizon of history itself.
